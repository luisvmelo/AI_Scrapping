# 3D Graph Visualization Deployment Guide

ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST FOR 3D GRAPH VISUALIZATION

1. SUPABASE SETUP:
   â–¡ Create new Supabase project
   â–¡ Copy supabase/complete_production_schema.sql
   â–¡ Run the schema in Supabase SQL editor
   â–¡ Verify all tables, views, and functions are created
   â–¡ Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies

2. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   â–¡ Update .env file with new Supabase credentials:
     SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
     SUPABASE_KEY=your_service_role_key

3. DATA MIGRATION:
   â–¡ Run scrapers to collect AI tools data
   â–¡ Use: python -c "from database.universal_merger import merge_tools_to_database; from scrapers.all_scrapers import run_all_scrapers; tools = run_all_scrapers(); merge_tools_to_database(tools, use_sqlite=False)"
   â–¡ Generate tool relationships: adapter.generate_similarity_relationships()
   â–¡ Refresh materialized views: adapter.refresh_materialized_views()

4. GRAPH VISUALIZATION:
   â–¡ Use adapter.get_graph_data() to fetch nodes and edges
   â–¡ Implement 3D visualization using Three.js or similar
   â–¡ Position nodes using graph_position JSONB field
   â–¡ Color nodes by domain using node_color field
   â–¡ Size nodes by popularity using node_size field

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   â–¡ Monitor query performance
   â–¡ Refresh materialized views regularly
   â–¡ Use pagination for large datasets
   â–¡ Implement caching for graph data

6. GRAPH FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
   â–¡ Interactive node exploration
   â–¡ Category-based clustering
   â–¡ Tool similarity connections
   â–¡ Search and filtering
   â–¡ Real-time updates
   â–¡ Export graph data
